        <h2 class="center">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Carol Vale Project is the first research task to help discover famous and influential people in your area of enrichment.  What makes them stand apart from the rest of humanity over time? What were their achievements? How did they become leaders in their field? What personal strengths and characteristics did they possess?</p>
        <p>Being part of the Enrichment Program is an opportunity for you to identify and explore your passions and most importantly, to learn that while it's important to develop your skills and passions, it is equally important to build qualities such as persistence, determination and a thirst for learning. Carol Vale embodies these characteristics, which she actively uses to make the world a better place.</p>
